# LSESU Data Science Society Michaelmas Term Project

This data science group project was carried out in Michaelmas Term 2021. The project focuses on analysing a big online retail dataset retrieved from UCI Machine learning Repository through combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. The objective of this project is to uncover associations between products that are purchased together and to identify patterns of co-occurrence. The project was **awarded runner-up** in best project showcase.

### Data Science Techniques 
- Data Pre-processing
- Data Analysis using visualizations
- Association Rules
- Unsupervised Learning (Apriori algorithm, K-means clustering or Principal Component analysis)

### Data Source
A retail dataset that contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II)
